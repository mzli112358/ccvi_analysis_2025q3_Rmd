- Conflict » Level of armed violence → Intensity of violence
  - 描述: Intensity of violence measures the direct local effects of armed violence on human life. The more people die as a result of armed violence, the higher the intensity of armed conflict is assumed to be. The indicator is a combination of all individual instances of armed violence within a grid cell in a given quarter.

  - Data recency: 2025-Q3
  - Source:
    - Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)

- Conflict » Level of armed violence → Surrounding violence
  - 描述: Surrounding violence accounts for the impact of conflicts not being limited only to the specific location where violence takes place. Not only does violence tend to spread geographically (“spillover effects”), but also the consequences of violence do, e.g. in the form of local migration or local economic effects. The indicator measures the average level of violence in close proximity to a grid cell based on the number of fatalities.
  - Raw unit: Number of fatalities in the past quarter.

- Conflict » Conflict context → Conflict actors
  - 描述: Conflict actors reflects the complexity of a conflict landscape in a country. The more actors are involved in a conflict context and the more active they are, the harder it is to solve it, increasing long-term risk. This indicator is built based on the number of organized actors within a country combined with the country-wide severity of conflict, relative to population size.

  - Raw unit: Percent of population undernourished.
  - Data recency: 2023-Q4
  - Source:
    - United Nations SDG Indicators Database

- Vulnerability » Political vulnerability → Gender inequality

Discriminatory formal and informal norms, rules and values might render women more vulnerable to hazards, for example, by restricting their movement and access to resources. This indicator combines various gender inequality indicators, taking into account a range of political and socio-economic inequalities.

- Vulnerability » Political vulnerability → Institutional vulnerability
  - 描述: The institutional vulnerability indicator measures institutional reliability and rule of law, as markers of good governance, on a reversed scale. Weak institutions increase vulnerability by leading to inefficient resource distribution, reducing coping and adaptation capacity, and potentially fueling grievances and conflict. This indicator is based on external indices of corruption and rule of law.

- Vulnerability » Political vulnerability → Political system vulnerability
  - 描述: Political system vulnerability measures individual rights and liberties of citizens within, and the fairness and inclusiveness of a political system on a reversed scale. Fewer liberties and less inclusive systems increase vulnerability, as policy decisions are less likely to address all societal groups’ opinions and needs. This indicator combines measures of electoral democracy, political rights and civil liberties at the country level.

- Vulnerability » Demographic vulnerability → Uprooted people
  - 描述: This indicator captures persons within a society forcibly uprooted from their homes and in need of assistance. Often marginally integrated into society with inadequate public support, displaced populations live in precarious conditions with limited access to services, leaving them more vulnerable than hosts. This indicator captures the share of forcibly displaced population within a country.
  - Raw unit: Uprooted people in total population.

- Vulnerability » Demographic vulnerability → Population growth
  - 描述: This indicator captures population-related pressure on public and natural resources. Rapid population growth drives vulnerability as it strains public resources, increases competition over jobs and resources and intensifies environmental pressure. The indicator is measured via the relative change in population over time, counting all residents regardless of their legal status or citizenship.
  - Raw unit: Change compared to last quarter.
  - Data recency: 2025-Q3
  - Source:
    - United Nations World Population Prospects (WPP)

- Vulnerability » Demographic vulnerability → Dependent population
  - 描述: This indicator highlights the pressure on public resources linked to non-working-age individuals (dependents). Dependents (children and elderly), are more vulnerable to hazards due to their unique characteristics; a high age dependency ratio also increases economic pressure on the workforce and public resources. This indicator measures dependents as a share of the working age population.
  - Raw unit: Population under 15 and over 65 compared to working-age population (15 to 64 years old).
  - Data recency: 2025-Q2
  - Source:
    - United Nations World Population Prospects (WPP)

- Vulnerability » Environmental vulnerability → Soil degradation
  - 描述: This indicator captures the degradation of soil ecosystems and services they provide. Soil degradation drives vulnerability by, e.g., decreasing water quality and soil productivity and reducing vegetative cover, worsening the impacts of hazards and rendering those directly dependent on ecosystems particularly vulnerable. This indicator measures the extent of soil degradation in a given grid cell.

    - Model of Agricultural Production and its Impact on the Environment (MagPie)
    - Land degradation debt

- Vulnerability » Environmental vulnerability → Deforestation
  - 描述: Deforestation approximates the degradation of forest ecosystems and the services they provide. Deforestation drives vulnerability by, e.g., removing natural buffers such as tree cover making areas more prone to hazards, and diminishing the availability of resources for communities that directly depend on forests. The deforestation indicator tracks tree cover loss between 2000 and 2022.
  - Raw unit: [%] of grid cell area experiencing tree cover loss up to a given year, compared to 2000.
  - Data recency: 2024-Q4
  - Source:
    - Global Forest Change

- Vulnerability » Environmental vulnerability → Biodiversity loss
  - 描述: This indicator captures the degradation of biodiversity and related services due to human pressure. Healthy, diverse ecosystems provide essential services that reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience to hazards, including improved adaptive capacity, clean water provision, and sustainable food production. This indicator captures biodiversity loss compared to natural conditions.
  - Raw unit: [%] of a grid cell’s biodiversity still intact compared to natural conditions.
  - Data recency: 2025-Q3
  - Source:

- Vulnerability » Environmental vulnerability → Water stress
  - 描述: Water stress occurs when all or most of the available renewable freshwater is being used, creating water shortages. Water stress, typically driven by insufficient availability, unsustainable use, and inadequate infrastructure, amplifies impacts of climate hazards and exacerbates vulnerability where water is already scarce. This indicator measures the extent of water stress  in a given grid cell.

- Vulnerability » Environmental vulnerability → Agricultural dependence on rainfall
  - 描述: This indicator captures the direct dependence of the agricultural sector on rainfall. Irrigation can be an important form of adaptation, reducing agricultural vulnerability to hazards such as droughts and changing rainfall patterns. This indicator measures the share of rainfed crop land within a grid cell.
  - Raw unit: [%] of a grid cell’s cropland classified as rainfed..
